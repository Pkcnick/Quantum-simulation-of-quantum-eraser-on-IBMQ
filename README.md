# Quantum-simulation-of-quantum-eraser-on-IBMQ
I developed a model of a quantum circuit and conducted simulations of the optical quantum eraser experiment using both a qasm-simulator and IBM's quantum computer. This experiment involved a Mach-Zehnder interferometer equipped with a variable partially-polarizing beam splitter (VPPBS). I then compared the results from the quantum simulator and the quantum computer, finding them to be identical. For these simulations, I used the Python programming language and the Qiskit open-source software development kit, which is designed for quantum computing applications.
